A modular PyTorch-based face recognition system with preprocessing, CNN training, evaluation, and inference pipeline for deep learning research and experimentation.

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based face recognition pipeline using a **custom ResNet-style CNN** trained with **ArcFace loss** for robust face verification and recognition.

The model learns discriminative embeddings such that:
- Faces of the **same identity** are closer in embedding space
- Faces of **different identities** are farther apart

This enables identity verification using similarity-based matching.

---

## Features

- Modular project structure
- Custom ResNet-style CNN backbone
- ArcFace metric learning
- 512-dimensional embeddings
- Image preprocessing pipeline
- Training & evaluation workflow
- Similarity-based face verification
- Notebook-based experimentation

---

## Model Architecture

### Backbone
Custom **ResNet-inspired CNN** with residual connections for hierarchical feature extraction.

### Embedding Layer
- Embedding size: **512**

### Metric Learning
**ArcFace Loss** improves:
- Inter-class separation
- Intra-class compactness
- Verification robustness

---

## Dataset

Training was performed on a subset of **VGGFace2**.

### Dataset Split
- Training identities: **~480**
- Validation identities: **~60**

Dataset includes variations in:
- Pose
- Illumination
- Expression
- Age
- Occlusion

> Dataset is not included in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

## Results

### Training Performance
- Train Accuracy: **95.05%**

### Verification Performance
- Verification Accuracy: **84.92%**
- Best Threshold: **0.15**

### Embedding Similarities

#### Train Set
- Positive Similarity: **0.7908**
- Negative Similarity: **-0.0041**

#### Validation Set
- Positive Similarity: **0.3436**
- Negative Similarity: **0.00385**

### Observations
- Strong clustering of training identities
- Good separation of negative pairs
- Validation gap suggests room for better generalization
